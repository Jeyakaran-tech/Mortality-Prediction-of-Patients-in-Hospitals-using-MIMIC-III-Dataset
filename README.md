# Mortality-Prediction-of-Patients-in-Hospitals-using-MIMIC-III-Dataset

In the recent times, the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed us the importance of health care industry. 
Several research studies are under progress which are trying to reduce the burden on the health care industry. 
Hospitals try to optimise their sources looking at the historical data of admission of patients and try to analyse the data to function at its optimal capacity. 
Today, with the help of machine learning and AI, we have tried to optimize the operations in every industry. 
Recently, machine learning techniques have been widely used in the health care for producing vaccines, genome sequencing and even for tracking 
and predicting the spread of diseases. This project is one such application of implementing machine learning models to predict the mortality rate 
of the patients getting admitted in the hospitals.
